## 👋 About Me

Hi there! I'm Cristina — a naturally curious and analytical thinker who has always loved learning and questioning how things work. That passion initially led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Molecular and Cellular Biology, influenced in part by a strong family background in healthcare.

While working in the healthcare field throughout high school and college, I discovered a deeper interest in research and data analysis. During my senior year, I took a leap into tech by completing IBM’s Data Science bootcamp on Coursera, where I learned how to code and began building a foundation in data science.

Since then, I've gained hands-on experience as a **Data Analyst Intern** at a neuroscience research center, and later as an **EDI Specialist at ADP** and an **Area Manager at Amazon**. These roles helped me sharpen my problem-solving skills, work effectively in fast-paced team environments, and apply technology to drive operational improvements.

Currently, I’m pursuing a **Master’s in Business Analytics** to bridge my science background with advanced analytical and business skills. I'm excited to continue growing in this field and applying data-driven solutions to real-world problems.

Thanks for checking out my work on GitHub!

### 📝 5. Canada's Logistic Performance Index (Jupyter Notebook, Excel, and Python)
This study analyzes Canada's Logistics Performance Index (LPI) from 2007 to 2023 using World Bank data to identify which of the six LPI components most significantly influence its overall score, with a focus on regression modeling and hypothesis testing.

### 🍷 6. Wine Quality (Jupyter Notebook, Linear Regression, and Python)
This project explores the relationship between physicochemical properties of wine (such as acidity, sugar, and alcohol content) and wine quality ratings. Using a multiple linear regression model, we analyze which features most influence wine quality, with alcohol emerging as the strongest positive predictor. The model was evaluated using R² and RMSE, and exploratory analysis with correlation heatmaps and scatter plots supported feature selection. This serves as a foundational project in predictive modeling and data interpretation.
