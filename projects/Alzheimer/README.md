### 🧬 Alzheimer's Nutrition & Genotype Study

This study investigates the relationship between **nutrition** and genetic markers associated with **Alzheimer's Disease** by analyzing a large dataset of over **18,000 mice**. The sample includes both **breeding and non-breeding** mice, as well as **male and female** populations.

#### 🧪 Background

Four genotypes commonly linked to Alzheimer's — **APOES, GBA, HLA, and G9** — were introduced into the mice population to simulate disease expression. The goal was to observe physiological and behavioral responses to different nutritional protocols within these genetically influenced groups.

#### 💻 Tools & Methods
- **Languages Used:** MATLAB & Python
- **Tasks Performed:**
  - Cleaning and processing of high-volume mouse data
  - Segmentation by genotype, sex, and breeding status
  - Generation of statistical and visual summaries

#### 📊 Output
The results, key visualizations, and insights from the analysis are presented in the slide deck below:
